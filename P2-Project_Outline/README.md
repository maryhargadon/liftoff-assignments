# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to create a lending library app where users can list and lend their own books, music albums, movies, and/or zines to other users.  I think users will enjoy having a medium to socialize and connect online, as well as find new things to do in their spare time.  The app could be especially useful to people practicing physical distancing during a pandemic because it provides a means of socializing online but also encourages hobbies that are offline.  I had originally wanted to build an app that would help me catalogue and organize my books, music records, and/or zines, but then I thought I could extend the idea by displaying my collection online and incorporating a borrowing system between me and other people.  I wanted to create an app that encourages sharing and provides a means of socializing and exchanging ideas without having to spend money (besides maybe shipping).

### Features
User profile: Users will be able to create their own secure profile that has a login password.

Create and edit collections: Users will be able to list their lendable items by categories, as well as define their own lending terms for each item.  Possible categories are books, music, movies, zines and other publications.  Items can also be displayed as "checked out" and users can create a waiting list for each item if needed.  Users can also create a wish list category for desired items that havenâ€™t been listed yet by other users.

View Collections: Users will be able to see other user profiles to browse their lending collections and wish lists.

Search Items: Users will be able to search for individual items and a list of available items by user can be viewed.  

Message system between users: Users will be able to communicate privately to each other about lending and borrowing items and how to exchange items (mail, drop off, etc)

### Technologies
Angular
Javascript/ Typescript
Bootstrap
(I am also currently researching what other technologies I could use)

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn how to set up secure user accounts.  I also need to learn more about using and managing databases.  I am also currently researching the names of the frameworks and programs I may need to learn.
